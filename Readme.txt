Summarize the project and what problem it was solving?
    This current project uses both C++ and Python to mimic a gorcery store.  The problem that it solves is:  he Corner Grocer needs a program that analyzes the text records they generate throughout the day.  
    
What did you do particularly well?
    I felt confident in incorporating the languages together, but I was always afraid of the potential syntax and sematic errors in individual lines.  I think what I did well was the commenting of the code and it made the code more readable.
    
  Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?   
  I think some of the improvements that could be made more efficient and secure would be dividing the code up better within the different langauge parts (more functions and classes).  
 Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
 I continue to use google and youtube to help me understand the individual concepts.  I personally do not learn well from reading, but by watching and implementing through practice.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
 With many apps, websites, video games and programs using multiple languages interacting with each other the skill i found most valuable was learning how to connect C++ and Python and seeing the benefits of having two or more programs talking to each other while also working seemlessly. Learning how to utilize Python to read and write files was also extremely helpful and beneficial.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maaintainable, readable, and adaptable by creating functions in both C++ and in Python that made the code easier to read and provide the ability if the code needs to be changed in the future. Another aspect of the code that helps in creating maintainable, readable, and adaptable is adding comments with clearly written details.
